    <h1>Dal</h1>
    <img src="../images/Dal.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dal Tadka is one of the most popular lentil dish served in Indian restaurants. Basically, dal tadka is cooked lentils which are tempered with oil or ghee fried spices & herbs.

    </p>
    <p>I have to admit that I simply love the dal tadka that is served at the restaurants even though we hardly eat out.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dal chana or arhar</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>  Rinse your lentils in water for 3 to 4 times. I would recommend using ½ cup toor dal (arhar dal or pigeon pea lentils) or ¼ cup each of tuvar dal and masoor dal (pink or orange lentils). </li>
        <li>After rinsing, pour the lentils into a 2-liter pressure cooker and toss in a pinch of turmeric powder and 1.5 cups of water.</li>    
        <li>Pressure cook the lentils for 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat, or until they are thoroughly cooked and completely soft. Once lentils are cooked, mash them with a spoon or wired whisk, then set aside.

            </li> 
        <li>Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil, ghee or unsalted butter in a pan or skillet. Once hot, add ½ or ¾ teaspoon of black mustard seeds.</li>
        <li> When you hear the mustard seeds start crackling, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and fry them with the mustard seeds for several seconds or until they change color. You should hear the same crackle for the cumin seeds!</li>
        <li> With the mustard and cumin seeds still in the pan, add ⅓ cup of chopped onions.</li>
        <li>When the onions have lightly browned, add in 1 to 1.5 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste and stir to combine. Sauté the mixture for a few seconds or until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic goes away on a low heat.</li>
        <li>Finally, add in 10 to 12 curry leaves, 2 to 3 dry red chilies, and 1 to 2 green chilies. Stir to combine with the ginger-garlic paste mixture.</li>
        <li>Add all the spice powders and mix again!
            <ul>
                <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne or smoked paprika (For a light smoky flavor)</li>
                <li>1 to 2 pinches of asafoetida, or hing (Skip if you do not have it.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>   
        <li> After mixing thoroughly, add about ⅓ to ½ cup of finely chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li><p> Stir together one more time and continue to sauté until the tomatoes become soft and pulpy.</p>
            <p>The oil should also start to leave the masala mixture, which is an indication that the onion-tomato base mixture is fully cooked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Add your mashed lentils to sautéed onion-tomato masala mixture in the pan or skillet.</li>
        <li>Combine and mix everything evenly with the rest of the masala mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 to 1.5 cups of water. You can adjust the consistency of dal fry by adding more or less water as per your taste preferences.</li>
        <li>Season with salt as per taste. Stir and mix again.</li>
        <li>It is ready to serve and savour.</li>
    </ol>
